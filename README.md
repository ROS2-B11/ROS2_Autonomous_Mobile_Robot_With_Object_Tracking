# ROS2_Autonomous_Mobile_Robot_With_Object_Tracking


This repository contains the code and resources for an autonomous mobile robot capable of object tracking.

## Overview

The Autonomous Mobile Robot with Object Tracking project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of a mobile robot to autonomously navigate its environment and track specific objects using computer vision. The robot utilizes a combination of sensors, such as a camera and range sensors, to perceive the environment and make decisions based on the detected objects.

## Features

**- Autonomous navigation:** The robot can navigate its environment without human intervention, avoiding obstacles and reaching a target destination.  
**- Object detection and tracking:** The robot can detect and track specific objects of interest using computer vision or sensors.  
**- Real-time feedback:** The robot provides real-time feedback through a user interface, displaying the tracked objects and navigation status.
